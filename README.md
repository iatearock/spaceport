## Spaceport Traffic Controller Game

Development of a simple space traffic game in Ada.

### Dependency

- [ASFML](github.com/mgrojo/ASFML) - binding for SFML, for display.

### Compile

Install dependency, `alr with asfml`.

To build with Alire, `alr build`.

May need to edit SOURCE_DIRS in game.gpr to point to the correct dependency.
